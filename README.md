## 🧭 About Me

I'm a **Senior Flutter Engineer** with **5+ years** of experience building high-performance, production-grade mobile applications for iOS and Android. I specialise in scalable architecture, clean code practices, and delivering polished user experiences.

My engineering journey started in web development — building with **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Vuejs and React.js** — before I went fully all-in on mobile with Flutter. That web foundation gave me a strong eye for UI composition and component design, but today **mobile is my world and Flutter is my craft**.

- 🏗️ I architect apps using **Clean Architecture**, **Feature-First**, and **Domain-Driven Design** principles
- 📦 I've published packages on **pub.dev** used by the Flutter community
- 🌐 Background in web (HTML, CSS, JS, Vue, React) — now fully dedicated to mobile
- 🔍 Deeply invested in code quality, CI/CD pipelines, and scalable team workflows
- 🌍 Currently based in **London, UK** · Open to remote opportunities

## 🗺️ My Journey

```
🌐 Started in Web       →  HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Vue.js, React.js — building UIs from scratch
📱 Discovered Flutter   →  Fell in love with cross-platform, one codebase, polished UX
🏗️ Went Deep on Mobile  →  Clean Architecture, state management, CI/CD, pub.dev packages
🎓 Became a Teacher     →  Udemy web courses; Flutter & Dart courses coming soon
🌱 Now Expanding        →  Python, Kotlin, NestJS, AI, ML — the journey continues

## 🏛️ Architecture & Engineering Philosophy

```
📐 Clean Architecture   →  Separation of concerns across data, domain & presentation
🚀 MVVM                 →  Model view view-model
🧩 Feature-First        →  Scalable folder structure for large teams
🔁 TDD                  →  Test-driven development for critical business logic
⚡ Performance-First    →  Frame budgets, lazy loading, efficient rebuilds
🔒 Security-Conscious   →  Secure storage, certificate pinning, obfuscation
```

I believe great mobile engineering isn't just about shipping features — it's about building systems that scale gracefully, onboard developers quickly, and hold up under production load.
